## Description :pen:
### Base Project
This application belongs to the CO<sub>2</sub>NLINE project which was created and implemented as part of the [coding IxD](https://www.codingixd.org) lecture of the [FU Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de) and the [KH Weissensee](https://www.kh-berlin.de). The topic of was `Digital Souveranity`. CO<sub>2</sub>NLINE is an artefact that visualizes one's digital carbon footprint. 
### Aim üèπ
This app is supposed to augment a real world artefact using AR technology. It tracks the frontface of the artefact and projects a virtuall model onto it.
This model replaces the artifact and adds a user interface. 
### Functionality ü¶æ
The augmented model will display the amount of carbon safed by the owner/user as bubble that float inside *the* artefact. Every day, a bubble whose size represents the amount of safed carbon will be added to the collection. <br>
Users can decide to donate their safed carbon which is visualized by abstract vines growing along the outside of the virtual artefact. For an exhibition a tour is implemented that guids users through the functionaliy of the app.
### Implementation üñ•Ô∏è
The application is implemented using [Unity3D](www.unity3d.com) and C#. Unity3D comes with a feature rich AR module and makes it easy to build apps for iOS and Android devices with the same codebase.<br>
3D objects are aranged in the Unity3D editor. Interactivity and custom functionality is added through C# scripts attached to these objects. For animation the [DOTween Library](http://dotween.demigiant.com/documentation.php) was used.
## Project structure üìÇ
### Assets 
The assets folder contains all content specific to this project. Scripts, 3D-models, textures etc.
#### Prefabs 
Prefabs are reusable objects, that can be added into a unity scene muliple times using code or the unity editor. Here is our `AR-Boilderplate` containing ar camera, lighting and so on. Additionally, the augmented artifact model is contained in this folder. This is added to the scene as soon as the frontface of the real-world artifact is recognised.
#### Images üì∑
This directory contains the image used for the tracking which is showing the frontface design.
#### Scenes üó∫Ô∏è
Here you can find the scenes of the project. Main is the scene used for `production` and `testGround` is a scene used for development.
#### Sounds üì¢
Sounds contains the sounds used for UI ü•≥
## Installation :computer:
**!! This code is only usable with a working Unity3D installation !!**<br>
Note: If you have never used unity, consider doing these [turorials](https://learn.unity.com)
1. Install [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download). This project was build using version `2021.2.8f1`
2. `git clone https://github.com/Carbon-Online/ar_application.git`
3. Open the project in unity, it takes Unity a while to install all necessary modules.
## Usage
You can:
1. build the project onto your device
2. jump into the code using your favourite texteditor
3. jump into the Unity Editor and tinker around with the 3D models.
